# Building a Custom Fume Evacuator for My Messy Desk Setup

&nbsp;

As a maker, I've accumulated quite a collection of tools and equipment in my office - from a Glowforge laser cutter tucked under my desk to a frequent need for soldering, gold leafing, and other adhesive-heavy processes on my desktop. While I love the creative freedom these tools provide, the fumes and particulates they generate can quickly become overwhelming, both in terms of air quality and the lingering odors.

&nbsp;

To address this challenge, I decided to design and build a custom fume evacuator that could effectively capture and extract the various emissions from my workspace. The key requirements were:

&nbsp;

1. **Accommodate the Glowforge**: Since my laser cutter resides under the desk, I needed a solution that could pull air from that lower area, rather than just the desktop surface.
2. **Versatile Capture**: With a wide range of activities happening on my desk, from soldering to adhesive work, I wanted the evacuator to be able to draw air from multiple locations as needed.
3. **Minimal Desktop Footprint**: As a maker, every inch of workspace is precious, so I wanted a design that would minimize the footprint on my desk.

&nbsp;

To bring this vision to life, I turned to an in-line ventilation and integrated it into a custom-built, "C-shaped" enclosure that clamps over the edge of my desk. This arrangement allows me to easily control the air intake locations by using sliding doors on each section of the evacuator.

&nbsp;

The overall design features a compact, modular structure that can be easily reconfigured to suit my evolving needs. By strategically positioning the air intake points, I can effectively capture the fumes and particulates from my laser cutter, soldering station, and other messy desktop activities, while maintaining a clean and organized workspace.

&nbsp;

One of the key challenges I faced was ensuring the evacuator's compatibility with the existing ventilation system for my 3D printers and laser cutters. After some careful planning and experimentation, I was able to seamlessly integrate the fume evacuator into the broader ventilation setup, creating a comprehensive air management solution for my entire office.

&nbsp;

Through this project, I've not only solved the issue of poor air quality and persistent odors, but I've also added a touch of personalization and style to my workspace. The decorative grilles and sliding doors give the evacuator a polished, professional appearance that fits right in with the rest of my maker-friendly office.

&nbsp;

Overall, this custom-built fume evacuator has been a game-changer for my productivity and comfort. By taking the time to design a solution that addresses the unique requirements of my workspace, I've created a functional and visually appealing tool that helps me maintain a clean, safe, and inspiring working environment.
