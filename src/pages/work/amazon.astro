          Delivered <strong>111,800 annualized labor hours removed</strong> in 2025 (≈62 FTE capacity)
          & multi-million-dollar recurring cost avoidance through disciplined evaluation mechanisms,
          prioritization, and operating cadence. Increased new work output 50% YoY (58,842 → 88,000 hours)
          while reducing team size from 16 to 5 FTE, achieving <strong>~3.5× productivity</strong> per person
          via workflow redesign and automation.

          Bar-raised quality by evaluating <strong>767 proposals</strong> and approving 53 implementations
          (7% conversion) to protect ROI, compliance, and operational integrity. Scaled Associate Idea Share
          from pilot into a governed global engine, establishing operating models, SOPs, intake standards,
          dashboards (Asana + QuickSight), onboarding mechanism, and executive stakeholder rhythms.

          Acted as a <strong>tech–ops bridge</strong>, diagnosing routing inefficiencies driving 68K monthly cases
          by mapping end-to-end architecture across Pathfinder, Photon, and P4S. Partnered with senior engineering
          leaders to define integration points, APIs, and edge-case handling; designed a 3-phase routing solution,
          aligned multiple orgs, scoped ~6 SDE-weeks, and drove approvals.

          <strong>Phase 1 forecast (Dec 2025):</strong> eliminate 386K annual cases, create 64 HC capacity,
          remove 265K annual touches, and surface shipment status for ~5M annual contacts without human intervention.

          Restored <strong>metrics integrity and capacity planning</strong> by quantifying model error
          (71% overhead vs prediction across 934 cases), resolving 10–45% variance from concurrency attribution,
          and securing approval for AHT + single concurrency rollout. Result: 10–25% forecasting accuracy
          improvement and downstream TP90 +5% / TP99 +7% gains.
